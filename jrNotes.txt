Machine:
	ibr8drogis02 & ibrsacgis006

Working Directory:
	E:\teacupsScript

Programs (E:\teacupsScript\_PROGRAM):
	Teacup.exe - custom program that builds the PNG and PDF graphics
	DroughtDataDownloader.exe - custom program that builds the data files for the teacups

Automation Batch Files (E:\teacupsScript):
	runUsbrTeacupDataGenerator.bat - runs DroughtDataDownloader.exe
	runUsbrTeacupGenerator.bat - runs Teacup.exe

Notes:
- The batch files are somewhat self documenting and shows how one might run the programs that generate the data and graphics files
- Source code for both programs are available from Jon Rocha (jrocha@usbr.gov) upon request
- JR 12DEC2023: The source code is located in the same directory where this text-file is located. A Visual Studio solution-file is also in the same directory to build and compile the programs from source code

Workflow:
1. There are Scheduled Tasks on the machine that runs the batch files
2. The programs and batch files generate the required files and copy them over to the RISE staging server at \\ibr8drofp001\PROD_RISEDATA\rise_resviz\intake
3. There is a sync program that copies files from the staging server to the public web server
