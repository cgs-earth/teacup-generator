# Elevation-Storage Curves for Reservoirs
#
# Some data sources report water surface elevation rather than storage volume.
# This file contains the lookup tables to convert elevation (ft) to storage (af).
#
# Format: location_id, elevation_ft, storage_af
# - Each location_id can have multiple rows defining the curve
# - Elevations should be in ascending order
# - Linear interpolation is used between points
#
# Sources:
# - 11507001 (Upper Klamath Lake): 2017 revision of UKL elevation-capacity curve
#   from KBAO Hydro Team (Daily_UKL_net_inflow_Apr2017_FINAL), revised 14Apr2017
#   Units: elevation = ft BOR datum, storage = acre-feet
#   Table includes present configuration with northern marshes and Tulana Farms/Goose Bay
